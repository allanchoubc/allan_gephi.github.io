The workshop content was adapted from Miriam Posner's [Gephi](http://miriamposner.com/dh101f15/index.php/creating-a-network-graph-with-gephi/) and [Palladio](https://miriamposner.com/blog/getting-started-with-palladio/) tutorials. 

The [workshop site](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-git/) uses the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) Jekyll theme.
