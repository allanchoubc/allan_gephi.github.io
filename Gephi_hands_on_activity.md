## Let’s try a Dataset in Gephi (Hands-on activity)

[GML file](https://gephi.org/datasets/lesmiserables.gml.zip). _Les Miserables: coappearance weighted network of characters in the novel Les Miserables_. D. E. Knuth, The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993).

**download a network file**

download this zip file and unzip it on your computer.

-You should find the file miserables.gexf in it.

-Save it in a folder you will remember (or create a folder specially for this small project).

**description of the file / the network**

This file contains a network representing "who appears next to whom" in the 19th century novel Les Misérables by Victor Hugo[1].

A link between characters A and B means they appeared on the same page or paragraph in the novel.

The file name ends with ".gexf", which just means this is a text file where the network information is stored (name of the characters, their relations, etc.), following some conventions.

**open the network in Gephi**

open Gephi. On the Welcome screen that appears, click on Open Graph File

find miserables.gexf on your computer and open it

**read the report after opening a file**

A report window will open, giving you basic info on the network you opened:

This tells us a few things:

-the network comprises 74 characters, and they're all connected by 248 links.

-Links are undirected, meaning that if A is connected to B, then it is the same as B connected to A.

-The report also tells us the graph is not dynamic: it means there is no evolution or chronology, it won’t "move in time".

- Click on OK to see the graph in Gephi.
