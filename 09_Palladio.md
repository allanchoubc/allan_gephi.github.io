**## What is a Palladio project?**

A Palladio project begins first with the tabular data you have on your computer. Once youâ€™ve uploaded this data into the Palladio interface, you can then refine it, visualize, and save it back to your computer as a Palladio project.

**## Which data formats work with Palladio?**

Any collection of information that can be represented in a table format (in other words, any data you might enter into a spreadsheet program) will work with Palladio. Make sure that all data is represented by delimited-separated values. Palladio supports the following delimiters: commas, semicolons and tabs.

## **Note that empty rows in your data will be ignored by Palladio.**

Palladio does not work with unstructured data, such as one long string of text, but only with data that has been placed into some kind of table. The richest uses of Palladio comes from having several different related tables of information, however many users will start with just one single table.
