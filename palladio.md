Palladio (palladio.designhumanities.org), a product of Stanford’s Humanities + Design Lab, is a web-based visualization tool for complex humanities data. Think of Palladio as a sort of Swiss Army knife for humanities data. It’s one package that includes a number of tools, each of which allows you to get a different angle on the same data.

Palladio is relatively new and still under active development which means that you will almost certainly encounter bugs! Still, it’s a very useful tool for getting a handle on a complicated dataset.
