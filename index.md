Network visualization is the process of visually presenting networks of connected entities as edges(links) and nodes.

Example projects:
* **[The Star Wars Social Network](http://evelinag.com/blog/2015/12-15-star-wars-social-network/)** - A look at the whole 6-movie cycle from a quantitative point of view and extract the Star Wars social networks, both within each film and across the whole Star Wars universe
