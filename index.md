  Several interesting phenomena can be modelled and analysed using graph theory. Graph theory, which Wikipedia tells me first had a paper published about it in 1736 (!) can at its most basic perhaps be thought of as mathematical techniques to analyse problems where one can represent the protagonists as a set of objects (nodes) and lines connecting them (edges).
