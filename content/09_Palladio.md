[Palladio](palladio.designhumanities.org), a product of Stanford’s Humanities + Design Lab, is a web-based visualization tool for complex humanities data. Think of Palladio as a sort of Swiss Army knife for humanities data. It’s one package that includes a number of tools, each of which allows you to get a different angle on the same data.

Palladio is relatively new and still under active development which means that you will almost certainly encounter bugs! Still, it’s a very useful tool for getting a handle on a complicated dataset.

## When Might Palladio be the Right Tool for You?

**You have structured data.**

- Here, “structured data” means “data in a spreadsheet”: categorized, sorted, and stored in an Excel document or some other kind of spreadsheet application.

**You’re interested in time, space, and relationships.**

- That’s where Palladio excels: showing you how various entities are connected across time and space.

**Your data has many attributes.**

- Palladio’s really good at helping you uncover relationships among disparate attributes over time and space for example, it can help you see that a diarist was especially interested in trees as he traveled through North Carolina, and especially interested in bats as he traveled through Arizona. Palladio allows you to drill down through your data using faceted browsing.

A Palladio project begins first with the tabular data you have on your computer. Once you’ve uploaded this data into the Palladio interface, you can then refine it, visualize, and save it back to your computer as a Palladio project.

**## Which data formats work with Palladio?**

Any collection of information that can be represented in a table format (in other words, any data you might enter into a spreadsheet program) will work with Palladio. Make sure that all data is represented by delimited-separated values. Palladio supports the following delimiters: commas, semicolons and tabs.

## **Note that empty rows in your data will be ignored by Palladio.**

Palladio does not work with unstructured data, such as one long string of text, but only with data that has been placed into some kind of table. The richest uses of Palladio comes from having several different related tables of information, however many users will start with just one single table.

Click on the Load Spreadsheet or CSV tab and drag your spreadsheet onto the tab. (If you have an Excel spreadsheet, save it as a .csv file before uploading it.) Then press Load.

**## Tips **

- Work slowly. Wait for an option to finish loading before you click it again or click something else.

- Do not refresh the page. You’ll lose your work.

- On a related note: To start over, refresh the page.

- Clicking on the Palladio logo will bring you to the Palladio homepage, but it won’t erase your work.
